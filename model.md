Sequelize v5 â†’ v6 Upgrade - Detailed Implementation & Testing Plan
Overview
This phase addresses the critical upgrade from Sequelize version 5 to version 6, which introduces several breaking changes that directly impact the application architecture. The upgrade requires careful handling of database operators, model definitions, and database interactions to ensure system stability and performance.
1.1 Breaking Changes Analysis & Implementation
1.1.1 Operators Alias Removal
Description: Sequelize version 6 has removed support for string-based database operators and the operators aliases configuration option. This change affects how database queries are constructed and executed.
Implementation Requirements:
